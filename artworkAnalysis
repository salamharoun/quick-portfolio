## Artwork Data Exploration

**Project description:** This project explores the relationships between user preferences and various factors, such as demographic traits, art style preferences, and personality traits, through data analysis and statistical modeling. Key objectives included evaluating preferences for classical versus modern art, understanding demographic influences, and predicting user political orientation based on responses. Advanced statistical techniques like PCA, dimensionality reduction, and classification models were employed to derive meaningful insights from a large and complex dataset.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

The project investigated the following hypotheses:

Users may prefer classical art over modern art.
Demographics such as gender or art education background influence art preferences.
Political orientation can be predicted based on users' preferences, personality traits, and activities.
The analysis revealed significant patterns, such as higher preference ratings for classical art and the influence of user traits like callousness on preference ratings.

```javascript
// Hypothesis example: Predicting political orientation
if (userPreferences && userDemographics) {
  return predictedPoliticalOrientation;
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

Statistical analyses were conducted with several considerations:

Data were ordinal and not normally distributed, making parametric tests unsuitable.
Missing data were handled by removing rows with NaNs to maintain dataset integrity.
Dimensionality reduction was utilized where appropriate to simplify analysis without losing critical information.
For example, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze differences in art preferences across independent groups due to the non-parametric nature of the data.

```javascript
if (dataType === 'ordinal' && distribution === 'nonNormal') {
  use('MannWhitneyUTest');
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

To address the research questions, the following tools were used:

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify critical factors affecting preferences.
Regression Models: Linear and logistic regression to predict art preferences and political orientation, accounting for data type limitations.
Clustering Algorithms: K-means with silhouette and elbow methods to define clusters in preference-energy relationships.

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
